# msteem
msteem is a webpage to modify the authorities of an account (owner, active, and posting keys) in order to support multisignatures. It also includes a page to sign any type of operation using multisignatures and broadcast it to the blockchain. This app has been developed to participate in the [Steem developer bounty - 1500 STEEM - Multisignature Transaction Guide](https://steemit.com/steem/@timcliff/steem-developer-bounty-1500-steem-multisignature-transaction-guide-details-inside).
